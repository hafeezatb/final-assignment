        <h1>Vendor Harassment And What You Can Do to Help</h1>
        <h2>By Hafeezat Bishi</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        The video of <a href="https://www.amny.com/news/i-felt-terrorized-cops-cuff-subway-fruit-vendor-at-broadway-junction/">María Falcón</a>, a woman selling fruit in a Brooklyn subway station, that went viral several weeks ago is one of many instances in which vendors have been targeted and harassed by NYPD. Not only do they lose their goods and their form of income, but they also lose their sense of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is humiliating for them to be escorted for simply looking to sustain themselves. The video resurfaced the topic of vendor harassment in the city and what measures should be put in place in order to prevent it from happening. 

        Back in March, <a href="https://citylimits.org/2022/03/03/nyc-street-vendor-enforcement-back-at-pre-pandemic-levels-despite-shift-away-from-nypd/">City Limits</a> reported that despite the switch to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protections being the overseeing body of street vendors from the NYPD, inspections have not decreased but have instead increased.

        <p>Based on their analysis, the inspections have been on par with inspections in the past, targeting low-income, largely immigrant neighborhoods. Click the dot on the map below to see which neighborhoods have been inspected the most since the start of 2022.</p>

    <p><strong>
        As the fight for legalization continues in Albany, here are some ways you can support vendors in the meantime:</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <u>Become a patron</u> - instead of spending money at a food chain during your lunch break, head over to the nearest vendor within your dietary needs! You may end up becoming a regular. </p>
    <p>
        <u>Film vendor interactions with DCWP, NYPD, and sanitation</u> - so many of us are armed with phones that can be utilized to provide evidence of mistreatment and harassment by these bodies. If you see something, document it, then share widely. </p>

    <p>
        <u>Befriend them</u> - vendors are humans, they're not below any of us despite what others may say. Asking them about their day can go a long way. Making your face known around the neighborhood builds trust and camaraderie.</p>

    <p>
        <u>Take political action</u> - contact your state representative and your city council representative. Let them know that you support the lifting of caps on permits for vendors, and that Senate Bill 1175 should be passed. Go to this site to find your <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/districts/"> councilmember</a> and this site to find your <a href="https://www.aqeny.org/find-your-new-york-state-legislators/">state senator and assemblymember</a></p>
